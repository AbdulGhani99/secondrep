    <article>Articles ("a," "an," and "the") are determiners or noun markers that function to specify 
        if the noun is general or specific in its reference. Often the article chosen depends on if 
        the writer and the reader understand the reference of the noun.

    <blockquote>"University" is a singular countable noun. Although it begins with a vowel, the first sound of 
        the word is /j/ or “y.” Thus, "a" instead of "an" is used. In this sentence,<br> 
        it is also generic (it could be any university with this specialization, not a specific one).
